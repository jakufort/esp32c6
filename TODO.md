# TODOs and ideas

## Temperature probe

- calibrate BME280
  - temperature offset through ice bath and ziplock bag
  - recompute humidity based on temperature (with offset) in code
- MQTT
- find out which cheaper (and smaller) esp32c6 board will work for this project
- move on from breadboard
  - perfboard?
- find housing/order 3d printed one
  - has to fit perfboard
  - maybe it would be good idea to have seperate housing for just BME280 to reduce esp32 heat influence

## TODOs

- figure out easiest (least messy) way to provide power to microcontrolers

## Ideas

- air quality sensor
  - battery powered
  - with solar panels that would charge battery
  - should get at least PM10 and PM2.5
  - enclosure appropriate for outdoor use

- indoor air quality sensor
